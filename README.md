# 📝 Atul's Text - OCR Web App

https://atulstext.vercel.app/

A simple web application that extracts text from images using **Tesseract.js** (a JavaScript port of the Tesseract OCR engine). Built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, this app demonstrates how to run OCR directly in the browser.

## 📸 Features

- 🔍 Perform OCR on uploaded images
- 💬 Display recognized text in real-time
- 🧠 Powered by Tesseract.js (runs entirely in the browser)
- 💡 Clean and simple UI
- 🖼️ Custom favicon on browser tab

## 🛠️ How It Works

This app uses [**Tesseract.js**](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js), a pure JavaScript OCR engine that works in the browser using WebAssembly.

When you upload an image:

1. Tesseract reads the image.
2. It extracts any text found in the image.
3. The extracted text is displayed in the UI.
